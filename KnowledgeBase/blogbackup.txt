function A:
push space for the return value
push parameters
push the return address
jump to the function B
function B:
push the address of the previous stack frame
push values of registers that this function uses (so they can be restored)
push space for local variables
do the necessary computation
restore the registers
restore the previous stack frame
store the function result
jump to the return address
function A:
pop the parameters
pop the return value

ulimit -c unlimited
Running the ulimit -a command, you will see a report on all user file limits. Core file size is one of these. Typically you'll see a value of zero, this means that core files will not occur.

In computing, a segmentation fault (often shortened to segfault) or access violation is a fault raised by hardware with memory protection, notifying an operating system (OS) about a memory access violation; on x86 computers this is a form of general protection fault. In short, a segmentation fault occurs when a program attempts to access a memory location that it is not allowed to access, or attempts to access a memory location in a way that is not allowed (e.g., attempts to write to a read-only location, or to overwrite part of the operating system).
